#Example: Define a VM and attach an existing disk to it. Notice that the cdrom arguments is not required if the disk exists already. 
#Since the disk exists there is no need to specify a boot image because the VM will boot from the disk.
#If you want to boot from a cdrom and install pfsense instead, you have to uncomment the commented cdrom line and add a 'size=' option to the disk argument.
